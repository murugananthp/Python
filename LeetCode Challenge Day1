We are given hours, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.
A day is considered to be a tiring day if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than 8.
A well-performing interval is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.
Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.

Example 1:
Input: hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest well-performing interval is [9,9,6].

Input: hours = [6,6,9]


class Solution:
  def longestWPI(self, hours: List[int]) -> int:
        d = collections.defaultdict(int)
        d[0] = -1
        total = 0
        ret = 0
        for i, h in enumerate(hours):
            if h > 8:
                total += 1
            else:
                total -= 1
            if total > 0:
                ret = i+1
            elif total - 1 in d:
                ret = max(ret, i - d[total-1])
            if total not in d:
                d[total] = i
        return ret
